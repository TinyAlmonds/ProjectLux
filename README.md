## Description
Project Lux is a 2.5D Metroidvania game and is developed with the help of Unreal Engine version *4.27*.

## Guidelines and Best Practices
> **Note**:  
> None of the upcoming sets of rules and 'best practices' are final and are open for suggestions or own experiences. Feel free to create Issues regarding this topic. Furthermore we try as much as possible to maintain a clean and maintainable project, but we're still an unexperienced team and have a lot to learn.

### Style guidelines for Unreal Engine 4
We follow the *Gamemakin LLC* style guidelines, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide). To simplify compliance with the rules the [Linter v2](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/linter-v2?sessionInvalidated=true) plugin is available for UE4, but unfortunately not yet for version *4.27*. As soon as this is the case, we'll make use of it in our project.

### Coding guidelines
For our codebase we follow the coding standard provided by the developers of the Unreal Engine, which can be found [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/CodingStandard/).
